## Description

To create this random password generator I have used js and starter code.

1.  I decided to use the prompt function to allow users to input data to generate the password. To prevent users from inputting letters or too few or too many numbers into the password generator I used an if statement.
2.  I used the alert statement to allow users to understand that mistake so they can rectify and generate a password. Users could only choose characters for their password if the length was between 8-128 characters.
3.  For characters I made sure to have 4 categories so users can generate a password for their specific needs. I used a spread operator to allow users to pick from passwordValues their specific character type.
4.  A password would only appear on your secure password if a category was chosen and a correct length specified. I used a .push and math floor and math random to create this random password generator.
